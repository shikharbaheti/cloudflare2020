# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to demonstate my full-stack development abilities.
I have been using ***Cloudflare's*** services ever since I was in high school. I created a forum for
a gaming community and used Cloudflare's free DNS to protect my website from malicious threats.

## Through this project, I learned:
- How to use the fetch() JavaScript function</h5>
- How to use <b>Cloudflare</b>'s Workers to deploy server less code</h5>
- Manipulate HTML through HTMLRewriter API</h5>
- How to create sub-domains and manage DNS</h5>

It would be an honor and a privilege to intern at a company whose services I have used for a long time.
I wish to improve my skills as a computer engineer by learning by doing and interning at CloudFlare this summer will enable me to do so.
